    "-> we can create a empty dict with a code like follow\n",

    "3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?\n",
    "-> A list refers to a collection of various index value pairs like that in the case of an array in C++. A dictionary refers to a hashed structure of various pairs of keys and values. We can create a list by placing all the available elements into a [ ] and separating them using “,” commas.\n",

    "5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and\n",
    "'cat' in spam.keys()?\n",
    "-> There is no difference. The in operator checks whether a value exists as a key in the dictionary. 'cat' in spam checks whether there is a 'cat' key in the dictionary, while 'cat' in spam. values() checks whether there is a value 'cat' for one of the keys in spam .\n",
