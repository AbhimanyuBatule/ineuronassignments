    "1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "-> True and False are the two types of the Boolean data type.Boolean data types use relation and logical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "-> There are three basic Boolean search commands: AND, OR and NOT. AND searches find all of the search terms. For example, searching on dengue AND malaria AND zika returns only results that contain all three search terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean\n",
    "values for the operator and what it evaluate ).\n",

    "    (5 < 4) and (3 == 5)\n",
    "    -> False\n",
    "    not (5 > 4)\n",

    "5. What are the six comparison operators?\n",
    "A comparison operator compares two values and returns a boolean value, either True or False . Python has six comparison operators: less than ( < ), less than or equal to ( <= ), greater than ( > ), greater than or equal to ( >= ), equal to ( == ), and not equal to ( != ).\n",
    "\n",
    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a\n",
    "condition and when you would use one.\n",
    "-> The “=” is an assignment operator is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left. The '==' operator checks whether the two given operands are equal or not. If so, it returns true. Otherwise it returns false.\n",

    "9. If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys you’ll press?\n",
    "-> we can stop it by pressing CTRL + C \n",
    "\n",
    "10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?\n",
    "-> The main difference between both the statements is that when break keyword comes, it terminates the execution of the current loop and passes the control over the next loop or main body, whereas when continue keyword is encountered, it skips the current iteration and executes the very next iteration in the loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?\n",
    "-> no there is no difference between those mentioned Ranges.\n",
